      <h1>Types of Malware</h1>
      <p>
        Malware, short for malicious software, is any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer,
        server, client, or computer network. Here are some common types of malware:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>1. Virus</h3>
          <p>
            A virus is a type of malware that attaches itself to clean files and spreads throughout a computer system,
            corrupting data and causing other damage. Viruses often require user interaction to spread, such as
            opening an infected file.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>2. Worm</h3>
          <p>
            Unlike a virus, a worm can spread without any user action by exploiting vulnerabilities in software.
            Worms can replicate themselves and spread across networks, consuming bandwidth and causing harm to systems.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>3. Trojan Horse</h3>
          <p>
            A Trojan horse is a deceptive program that tricks users into running it by disguising itself as a legitimate
            application. Once activated, it can steal sensitive data or allow unauthorized access to the infected
            system.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>4. Ransomware</h3>
          <p>
            Ransomware encrypts a victim's files and demands payment (usually in cryptocurrency) for the decryption key.
            This type of malware can have devastating effects on individuals and organizations, leading to data loss and
            financial damage.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>5. Spyware</h3>
          <p>
            Spyware is designed to gather information about a user or organization without their knowledge. It can track
            user activities, collect keystrokes, and send data back to the attacker, often resulting in privacy violations.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>6. Adware</h3>
          <p>
            Adware automatically delivers advertisements to a userâ€™s computer. While not always harmful, it can degrade
            system performance and be intrusive. Some adware may also track user behavior without consent.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>7. Rootkit</h3>
          <p>
            A rootkit is a collection of software tools that enable unauthorized users to gain control of a computer
            system without being detected. Rootkits can hide their existence and the presence of other malware.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>8. Keylogger</h3>
          <p>
            A keylogger is a type of spyware that records keystrokes made by a user. It is often used to steal
            sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords, and can be difficult to detect.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>9. Bots/Botnets</h3>
          <p>
            Bots are automated programs that perform specific tasks online. A botnet is a collection of infected
            devices that are controlled by a single attacking party. Botnets can be used for various malicious
            activities, including distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>10. Fileless Malware</h3>
          <p>
            Fileless malware operates in-memory and does not write itself to the disk, making it harder to detect. It
            often exploits vulnerabilities in software or uses legitimate system tools to execute malicious activities
            without leaving traces.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
